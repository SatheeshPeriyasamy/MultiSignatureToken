# MultiSignatureToken Contract
The MultiSigToken contract implements a multi-signature wallet functionality for managing a cryptocurrency token within a group of owners. This system requires a predefined number of approvals from the group before any transaction can be executed, enhancing security and providing a decentralized governance model.

The contract allows for:
- Adding and managing owners.
- Proposing transactions (e.g., minting new tokens).
- Signing and executing transactions with multi-signature validation.
- Querying balances of token holders.
